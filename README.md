# Real-Time-Low-Pass-FIR-Filter-for-Accelerometer-Data
Sure! Here's a version under 350 characters:  **Implemented a real-time low-pass FIR filter using a Hamming window to smooth 3-axis accelerometer data on an STM32 microcontroller. Utilized CMSIS-DSP libraries for optimized performance, with sensor data acquired via I2C and filtered output transmitted over UART.**
